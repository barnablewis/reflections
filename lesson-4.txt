When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you want to share work with others or work on multiple machines.
if you want a cloud based backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
so that you can check what changes are happening and when. It allowes you to detect bugs more easily
